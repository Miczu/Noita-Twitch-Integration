## Contributing
Feel free to make PR with new TI vote options. I'll review it and give suggestions to keep the ballpark of intendent balance.
Let me know if you are looking to have [Wiki Page](https://github.com/Miczu/Noita-Twitch-Integration/wiki) expanded with anything you find missing for contributibuting.

Make sure to add/change the file hashes of the files you've created/changed in `manifest.json`!
You can run `node update.js` to do that automatically (for new files add dummy entries to it!), just dont forget to actually do that and add it to your commit.
